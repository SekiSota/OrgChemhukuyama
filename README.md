This is the first app for organic chemistry learners with'演習で学ぶ有機反応機構'ISBN978-4-7598-1045-5. This book is written in Japanease language as you think when you have a shufty at the title of this book. However, the contents of this book is awesome and it must benefit all chemist.

This app randomly select A or B questions. C questions are so advanced contents that I cannot solve it and this is the reason that this app dosen't support them.
Enjoy Organic chemistry!

Caution;
This program contains two file, python.file and csv.file. You must put them in same directory. Unless that, it dosen't work. 
For non-python users, I made exe.file version of this app, however, the size of the exe.file is beyond the limit of github system. If you wanna get it, please contact me.
